Embedded Systems Engineer | IoT Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner
</h3>

🚀 Welcome to my profile!
I'm a passionate Embedded Systems Engineer with a particular interest in the 
ever-evolving world of IoT and AI.
My fascination with technology extends beyond my professional life, finding roots in my childhood love for the Star Wars universe and the endless creativity sparked by LEGO bricks.

🌐 On my GitHub, I love to share projects close to my heart, reflecting my journey and discoveries in embedded systems, particularly focusing on STM32 projects.

🍽️ "Your body is a reflection of what you eat" they say, and in that spirit, I'd say I'm a 🧁

🎨 Currently, I'm diving into the world of 3D modeling, exploring Blender and Fusion360. It's a thrilling journey that marries my technical skills with artistic creativity, opening new horizons in my professional and personal development.

🍹 Outside of tech, I have a budding interest in mixology. Learning the art of crafting beautiful cocktails not only satisfies my curiosity but also adds a touch of elegance to my day. Speaking of which, check out the <a href="#cocktail">"Cocktail of the Day"</a> section below!

✨ I am constantly on a quest to learn and grow, and I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts in the tech community.

🔗 <i>Let's innovate and inspire together!</i>

"Good afternoon, madam.  How may I help you?""Good afternoon.  I'd like a FrintArms HandCannon, please.""A--?  Oh, now, that's an awfully big gun for such a lovely lady.  Imean, not everybody thinks ladies should carry guns at all, though Isay they have a right to.  But I think... I might... Let's have a lookdown here.  I might have just the thing for you.  Yes, here we are!Look at that, isn't it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,but it's what's called a laser -- a light-pistol some people callthem.  Very small, as you see; fits easily into a pocket or bag; won'tspoil the line of a jacket; and you won't feel you're lugging half atonne of iron around with you.  We do a range of matching accessories,including -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish Igot to do the fitting for that!  Ha -- just my little joke.  Andthere's *even*... here we are -- this special presentation pack: gun,charged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holsterwith adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on yournext battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for freelessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there's the *special*presentation pack; it has all the other one's got but with *two*charged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don'tworry, it's a dummy battery -- isn't it neat?  Feel how light it is?Smooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*beautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there'sno recoil.  Because it's shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,beautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That's not a line, shereally has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a freecharge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a specialoffer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, forone-forty-nine.""I'll take the special.""Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.  Now, do--?""And a HandCannon, with the eighty-mill silencer, five GP clips, threesix-five AP/wire-fl'echettes clips, two bipropellant HE clips, and aSpecial Projectile Pack if you have one -- the one with the embeddingrounds, not the signalers.  I assume the night-sight on this toy iscompatible?""Aah... yes,  And how does madam wish to pay?"She slapped her credit card on the counter.  "Eventually."		-- Iain M. Banks, "Against a Dark Background"
