Embedded Systems Engineer | IoT Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner
</h3>

🚀 Welcome to my profile!
I'm a passionate Embedded Systems Engineer with a particular interest in the 
ever-evolving world of IoT and AI.
My fascination with technology extends beyond my professional life, finding roots in my childhood love for the Star Wars universe and the endless creativity sparked by LEGO bricks.

🌐 On my GitHub, I love to share projects close to my heart, reflecting my journey and discoveries in embedded systems, particularly focusing on STM32 projects.

🍽️ "Your body is a reflection of what you eat" they say, and in that spirit, I'd say I'm a 🍝

🍹 Outside of tech, I have a budding interest in mixology. Learning the art of crafting beautiful cocktails not only satisfies my curiosity but also adds a touch of elegance to my day. Speaking of which, check out the <a href="#cocktail">"Cocktail of the Day"</a> section below!

✨ I am constantly on a quest to learn and grow, and I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts in the tech community.

  <summary>🥠 Fortune cookie</summary>
We were young and our happiness dazzled us with its strength.  But there wasalso a terrible betrayal that lay within me like a Merle Haggard song at aFrench restaurant. [...]	I could not tell the girl about the woman of the tollway, of her milkwhite BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a fight.  I had punched herboyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone told him, "You ride thebull, senor.  You do not fight it."  But he was lean and tough like a badrib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he fought me.  And when we finishedthere were no winners, just men doing what men must do. [...]	"Stop the car," the girl said.	There was a look of terrible sadness in her eyes.  She knew about thewoman of the tollway.  I knew not how.  I started to speak, but she raised anarm and spoke with a quiet and peace I will never forget.	"I do not ask for whom's the tollway belle," she said, "the tollwaybelle's for thee."	The next morning our youth was a memory, and our happiness was a lie.Life is like a bad margarita with good tequila, I thought as I poured whiskeyonto my granola and faced a new day.		-- Peter Applebome, International Imitation Hemingway		   Competition
