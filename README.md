Embedded Systems Engineer | IoT Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner
</h3>

🚀 Welcome to my profile!
I'm a passionate Embedded Systems Engineer with a particular interest in the 
ever-evolving world of IoT and AI.
My fascination with technology extends beyond my professional life, finding roots in my childhood love for the Star Wars universe and the endless creativity sparked by LEGO bricks.

🌐 On my GitHub, I love to share projects close to my heart, reflecting my journey and discoveries in embedded systems, particularly focusing on STM32 projects.

🍽️ "Your body is a reflection of what you eat" they say, and in that spirit, I'd say I'm a 🥖

🍹 Outside of tech, I have a budding interest in mixology. Learning the art of crafting beautiful cocktails not only satisfies my curiosity but also adds a touch of elegance to my day. Speaking of which, check out the <a href="#cocktail">"Cocktail of the Day"</a> section below!

✨ I am constantly on a quest to learn and grow, and I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts in the tech community.

🔗 <i>Let's innovate and inspire together!</i>
