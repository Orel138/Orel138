Embedded Systems Engineer | IoT Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner
</h3>

🚀 Welcome to my profile!
I'm a passionate Embedded Systems Engineer with a particular interest in the 
ever-evolving world of IoT and AI.
My fascination with technology extends beyond my professional life, finding roots in my childhood love for the Star Wars universe and the endless creativity sparked by LEGO bricks.

🌐 On my GitHub, I love to share projects close to my heart, reflecting my journey and discoveries in embedded systems, particularly focusing on STM32 projects.

🍽️ "Your body is a reflection of what you eat" they say, and in that spirit, I'd say I'm a 🍫

🍹 Outside of tech, I have a budding interest in mixology. Learning the art of crafting beautiful cocktails not only satisfies my curiosity but also adds a touch of elegance to my day. Speaking of which, check out the <a href="#cocktail">"Cocktail of the Day"</a> section below!

✨ I am constantly on a quest to learn and grow, and I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts in the tech community.

🔗 <i>Let's innovate and inspire together!</i>

  <summary>🥠 Fortune cookie</summary>
Q:	How many members of the U.S.S. Enterprise does it take to change a	light bulb?A:	Seven.  Scotty has to report to Captain Kirk that the light bulb in	the Engineering Section is getting dim, at which point Kirk will send	Bones to pronounce the bulb dead (although he'll immediately claim	that he's a doctor, not an electrician).  Scotty, after checking	around, realizes that they have no more new light bulbs, and complains	that he "canna" see in the dark.  Kirk will make an emergency stop at	the next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to procure a light bulb	from the natives, who, are friendly, but seem to be hiding something.	Kirk, Spock, Bones, Yeoman Rand and two red shirt security officers	beam down to the planet, where the two security officers are promply	killed by the natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.	As something begins to develop between the Captain and Yeoman Rand,	Scotty, back in orbit, is attacked by a Klingon destroyer and must	warp out of orbit.  Although badly outgunned, he cripples the Klingon	and races back to the planet in order to rescue Kirk et. al. who have	just saved the natives' from an awful fate and, as a reward, been	given all light bulbs they can carry.  The new bulb is then inserted	and the Enterprise continues on its five year mission.
