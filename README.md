Embedded Systems Engineer | IoT Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner
</h3>

🚀 Welcome to my profile!
I'm a passionate Embedded Systems Engineer with a particular interest in the 
ever-evolving world of IoT and AI.
My fascination with technology extends beyond my professional life, finding roots in my childhood love for the Star Wars universe and the endless creativity sparked by LEGO bricks.

🌐 On my GitHub, I love to share projects close to my heart, reflecting my journey and discoveries in embedded systems, particularly focusing on STM32 projects.

🍽️ "Your body is a reflection of what you eat" they say, and in that spirit, I'd say I'm a 🍦

🎨 Currently, I'm diving into the world of 3D modeling, exploring Blender and Fusion360. It's a thrilling journey that marries my technical skills with artistic creativity, opening new horizons in my professional and personal development.

🍹 Outside of tech, I have a budding interest in mixology. Learning the art of crafting beautiful cocktails not only satisfies my curiosity but also adds a touch of elegance to my day. Speaking of which, check out the <a href="#cocktail">"Cocktail of the Day"</a> section below!

✨ I am constantly on a quest to learn and grow, and I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts in the tech community.

🔗 <i>Let's innovate and inspire together!</i>

The Least Perceptive Literary Critic	The most important critic in our field of study is Lord Halifax.  Amost individual judge of poetry, he once invited Alexander Pope round togive a public reading of his latest poem.	Pope, the leading poet of his day, was greatly surprised when LordHalifax stopped him four or five times and said, "I beg your pardon, Mr.Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me."	Pope was rendered speechless, as this fine critic suggested sizeableand unwise emendations to his latest masterpiece.  "Be so good as to markthe place and consider at your leisure.  I'm sure you can give it a betterturn."	After the reading, a good friend of Lord Halifax, a certain Dr.Garth, took the stunned Pope to one side.  "There is no need to touch thelines," he said.  "All you need do is leave them just as they are, call onLord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observationon those passages, and then read them to him as altered.  I have known himmuch longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event."	Pope took his advice, called on Lord Halifax and read the poemexactly as it was before.  His unique critical faculties had lost none oftheir edge.  "Ay", he commented, "now they are perfectly right.  Nothing canbe better."		-- Stephen Pile, "The Book of Heroic Failures"
